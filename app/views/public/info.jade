			//- | Humans vs. Zombies is a game played around the world on college campuses, at libraries, and in other public settings. It pits teams of humans against a team of zombies that grows as then humans are conquered. They must defend themselves with simple weapons like nerf guns and socks, while the zombies are limited to a glorified game of tag. Over the course of a week, who will survive the outbreak?
